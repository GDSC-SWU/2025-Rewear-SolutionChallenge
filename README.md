# 👕 2025-Rewear-SolutionChallenge

## 📢 Project Introduction
Rewear is a platform that encourages sustainable consumption by reducing fast fashion waste through clothing exchange and upcycling.

When you have a lot of clothes in your closet, you usually throw them away or sell them secondhand. However, selling them secondhand can be too much of a hassle. For those who want to easily exchange clothes or have a new experience through upcycling, we provide a service through the Rewear app.
