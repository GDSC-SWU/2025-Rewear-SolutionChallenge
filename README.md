# 👕 2025-Rewear-SolutionChallenge

## 📢 Project Introduction
**Rewear is a platform that encourages sustainable consumption by reducing fast fashion waste through clothing exchange and upcycling.**

When your closet is overflowing, the usual options are throwing things away or reselling, but secondhand selling can be too much hassle. Rewear provides a simple and enjoyable way to exchange clothes and discover new value through upcycling — all in one service.


## 📌 Our Goal : Let's reduce fast fashion culture !
